# Porter-Delivery-Time-Estimation
***Porter Delivery Time Estimation using Neural Networks Regression***

- Built a regression-based machine learning model to estimate food delivery time using order details, pricing information, restaurant attributes, and delivery partner availability.
- Engineered time-based and operational features from raw timestamps and logistics data to improve prediction accuracy.
- Evaluated multiple models and validated results using appropriate regression metrics to ensure reliability and robustness.
- Translated model outputs into customer-facing delivery time estimates to improve user experience and operational planning.
- ***Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Neural Network***
